# Web Technologies – Portfolio & Lab Book

This repository collects the exercises and small implementations I developed while attending a university course in Web Technologies.

It is not a single project.
Instead, it documents my learning path while studying how web applications actually work, starting from basic HTML pages and progressively moving toward JavaScript interaction and simple backend applications.

The purpose of this repository is to show practical experience and familiarity with the main concepts of web development.

## Topics covered

While working on these exercises I practiced:

* HTML page structure and forms
* CSS layout (box model, positioning, responsive behavior)
* JavaScript fundamentals (objects, arrays, JSON)
* DOM manipulation and event handling
* Asynchronous requests (AJAX)
* Basic HTTP concepts (cookies and sessions)
* Node.js and Express applications
* Simple MVC organization
* Authentication middleware examples
* MongoDB and JSON data usage
* WebSockets and real-time communication
* Introductory frontend frameworks (Vue, AngularJS, React)

The repository contains **source code only**.
Dependencies are excluded on purpose.

If a folder contains a `package.json`, you can run the project locally with:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Suggested folders to explore

For a quick overview of my coding style and understanding:

* `04-dom/` → interactive behavior and event handling
* `09-node-express/` → simple backend logic
* `10-mvc-pattern/` → project organization
* `13-realtime-websockets/` → client/server interaction

The other folders represent earlier steps of the learning process.

## Academic context

These exercises were originally part of a university course.
All implementations and modifications in the code are written by me and published here as a personal learning portfolio

The repository is shared only for demonstration and educational purposes.
